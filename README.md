For screening in the GEO database (GEO, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo), we used the gene expression profile of human prefrontal cortex brain tissue as a criterion in order to better distinguish between healthy populations and AD patients. Two databases, GSE33000 and GSE122063, were screened using the "GEOquery" R tool. Tissue samples from the cortex of 157 healthy individuals (aged 22 to 106 years) and 310 individuals with Alzheimer's disease (aged 53 to 100 years) were chosen from the GSE33000 collection (GPL4372 platform). For validation analysis, the GSE122063 dataset (GPL16699 platform) was used, which had cortex tissues from 44 normal (ages 60–91) samples and 56 AD (ages 63–91) samples.
